My name in Richard and im 31 years old, married with two cats. For the moment im living in Philadelphia, US. I been working with software and the web for almost 8 years, and before that played basketball professional for a couple of years.

JavaScript have been my language of chioce for the majority of the time. A litte bit pf C# when its need calls for it. Most of my coding lately have been evolving the framework Ember but want to dig into React/Vue or some other hip framework. C# for majority of the backend. And the pre-compiler of choice been Less, due to its early node nature. Today SASS have the option to be added through npm and, what the majority of users seems to agree on, the preferred pre compiler.
