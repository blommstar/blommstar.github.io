### Personal thoughts
Lovely concept. Easy to get up and running and update. To abstact the backend helps the developer in most scenarios since YAGNI, you aint gonna need it. Myself is a classic example of adding unnessecary stuff to my project. A full stack react project with Redux, GraphQL and websockets in a kubernetes kluster for moms food blog with 5 yearly vistors anyone? SSGs makes things get done in an easy way â€” does more than enough for, in my case, most situations.
