## robots.txt
My robots.txt for this project is maybe not the most exciting. Since i have no interest in getting this site indexed by any search engine i made i just made it block all big web crawlers from accessing the root.

## humans.txt
Intended for humans some descriptions about the people behing the site and other information that could be of interest. More "nice to have" whereas robots.txt should in most cases be added.
