## Disqus
I used, for the first time, Disqus which providing commenting functionality to pages on the site. Since SSG cant rely on a backend with DB its abstracted by Disqus that provides an api that is somewhat easy to integrate with.

I was having some issues to getting it to work, vaiable not loading before script, didnÂ´t realise gostery blocked it and such but with som trial and error got it up and running. And once in place doing a good job and easy to maintain.
